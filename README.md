# HelloWifi v3.1
written years ago. uploaded as part of me uploading all my old projects\
HelloWifi V3.1 mass handshake capture tool\
THIS PROGRAM WAS WRITTEN AS A PROOF OF CONCEPT. DONT USE IT. I ACCEPT NO RESPONSIBILITY FOR YOUR ACTIONS.\
I write this program as an attempt to make a "hollywood hacker movie" style script. you run it and it emails you your neighbors wifi passwords.\
written for linux. puts a wifi card into monitor mode and does a mass deauth attack to capture handshakes of every AP in range.\
has the option to upload the handshake to a remote cracking site. requires email for updates\
i have no idea if it still works\
again seriously dont use this. i wrote it as a proof of concept and nothing else\
